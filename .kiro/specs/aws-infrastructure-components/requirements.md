# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive set of reusable AWS infrastructure components using Pulumi with TypeScript. The project aims to build a portfolio of infrastructure-as-code components that follow DRY principles, include comprehensive testing, implement governance through policy-as-code, and provide automation capabilities similar to Terragrunt's run-all feature. The components will be designed for sharing and reuse across different AWS environments and organizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want reusable infrastructure components that follow DRY principles, so that I can efficiently deploy consistent infrastructure across multiple environments without code duplication.

3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate component functionality and configuration options
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL follow Pulumi testing best practices and documentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want policy-as-code governance implemented, so that I can ensure all infrastructure deployments comply with organizational security and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL implement Pulumi CrossGuard with AWS Guard policies
2. WHEN policies are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN governance is configured THEN the system SHALL enforce organizational security standards automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automation API capabilities similar to Terragrunt run-all, so that I can deploy multiple stacks and components efficiently with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL support deploying multiple stacks through automation API
2. WHEN automation runs THEN the system SHALL handle dependencies between stacks appropriately
3. WHEN automation is configured THEN the system SHALL provide run-all functionality for component deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want an ECR component with cross-region replication, so that I can manage container registries with high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

3. WHEN ECR component is deployed THEN the system SHALL support sharing repositories within AWS organization when specified
4. WHEN ECR component is configured THEN the system SHALL support adding lifecycle policies through input specifications
5. WHEN ECR component is created THEN the system SHALL accept regions as property inputs
6. WHEN ECR component is developed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want an IPAM component shared within AWS organization, so that I can centrally manage IP address allocation across multiple accounts and regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IPAM component is created THEN the system SHALL support sharing within AWS organization
2. WHEN IPAM component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept CIDR block specifications as input
3. WHEN IPAM component is developed THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for functionality validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want a flexible VPC component that integrates with IPAM and Transit Gateway, so that I can deploy consistent network infrastructure with proper IP management and connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VPC component is developed THEN the system SHALL first check for existing Pulumi VPC packages before creating custom implementation
2. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL retrieve CIDR blocks from IPAM using provided IPAM ARN
3. WHEN VPC component is deployed THEN the system SHALL support Transit Gateway attachment using provided Transit Gateway ARN
4. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept region specification for deployment
5. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling Internet Gateway
6. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling NAT Gateway
7. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept configurable number of Availability Zones
8. WHEN VPC component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept subnet specifications as a map with public/private type, CIDR prefix for host allocation, and Transit Gateway subnet designation
9. WHEN VPC component is developed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a Route 53 component for DNS management, so that I can handle domain name resolution consistently across my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Route 53 component is developed THEN the system SHALL first check for existing Pulumi Route 53 packages
2. IF no suitable package exists THEN the system SHALL create a custom Route 53 component
3. WHEN Route 53 component is developed THEN the system SHALL include unit tests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want an ACM component for SSL/TLS certificate management, so that I can automate certificate provisioning and validation across regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ACM component is developed THEN the system SHALL first check for existing Pulumi ACM packages
2. WHEN ACM component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept region specification for deployment
3. WHEN ACM component is deployed THEN the system SHALL validate ACM certificate functionality
4. WHEN ACM component is developed THEN the system SHALL include unit tests

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want an RDS global database component, so that I can deploy highly available databases across multiple regions with automated failover capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RDS global database component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept multiple regions for deployment
2. WHEN RDS global database component is configured THEN the system SHALL accept subnet specifications as input OR create subnets with security group rules
3. WHEN RDS global database component is developed THEN the system SHALL include unit tests
